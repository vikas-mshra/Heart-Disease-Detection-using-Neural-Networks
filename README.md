# Heart Disease Detection using Neural Networks

## Overview

This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model based on neural networks for the detection of heart disease. Heart disease is a critical health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and diagnosis are crucial for timely intervention and treatment.

The primary dataset used in this project is `heart_statlog_cleveland_hungary_final.csv`. The dataset contains various health-related features, including patient demographics, medical history, and diagnostic test results.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Preparation and Preprocessing:** In this section, we handle data cleaning, missing value imputation, outlier removal, and the encoding of categorical variables to prepare the dataset for training.

2. **Neural Network Model:** We design and implement a neural network model for heart disease detection. The architecture includes multiple layers, activation functions, and optimization techniques.

3. **Training and Evaluation:** We split the dataset into training and testing sets, train the neural network model, and evaluate its performance using relevant metrics.

4. **Results:** This section discusses the project's findings, including model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Dependencies:** We list the necessary libraries and dependencies in this section to help users set up their development environment.

6. **Usage:** Instructions for running and using the project are provided here.
